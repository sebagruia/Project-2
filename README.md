## Restart Game

The game can be restarted at any moment during the game by pressing the **Restart icon** button

## Instructions

*   If in the interval of 60 s the player doesn't discover all the card pairs, the game stopes. The player can restart the game right away by pressing the **Let's try again** button.
*   If in the interval of 60 s the player discovers all the card pairs, a congratulation message pops up, and the player has the possibility to restart the game by pressing the **Another Round** button. 
* The game has a performance system that is related to the time interval and is graphically represented by 3 black stars. Each star represents 1/3 of the time interval. While the time progresses, the black stars change into white ones.


## Dependencies

* For the game counter I've used the easytimer.js library [easytimer.js](https://albert-gonzalez.github.io/easytimer.js/)


## Preferences

* You can set the time of the game as you like by changing the
```
const gameTime = 60000;
```
